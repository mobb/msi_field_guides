Fishing for certain species is allowed in California kelp forests that are outside the boundaries of Marine Protected Areas. You can view maps of these boundaries, as well as regulations for different species at the California Fish and Wildlife website (<a href=Ó http://www.dfg.ca.gov/Ó>www.dfg.ca.gov</a>). </p></font></body></html>
