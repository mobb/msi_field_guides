Kelp fronds depend on moving water to provide a steady supply of nutrients for photosynthesis. Changes in water temperature, such as the warm trend associated with El Nino conditions, can devastate kelp forests. Disease, pollution, introduced species and overfishing are also threats. Human-caused climate change poses a threat to kelp forests and ocean ecosystems due to warming waters, intense storms, nutrient disruption and ocean acidification.  Scientists monitor kelp forests to learn more about their structure and function and to understand how density and abundance of algae, invertebrates and fishes affect kelp forest communities. Certain species are monitored regularly to learn more about population changes and the impact of both natural and human-induced changes.</p></font></body></html>
