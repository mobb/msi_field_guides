For some endangered and protected species, such as red and green abalone to the sea otter, the kelp forest is a vital habitat. Kelp forests provide valuable economic benefits including important fisheries such as lobster, abalone and rockfish. Kelp also provides amazing diving, fishing and kayaking opportunities. Kelp forests have been important to humans for thousands of years, and it is now widely thought that the first colonization of the Americas was due to fishing communities following the Pacific kelp forests along the <i>kelp highway</i> from northeast Asia to the California Channel Islands during the last Ice Age.</p>    </body></html>
