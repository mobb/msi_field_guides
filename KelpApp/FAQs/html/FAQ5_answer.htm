<html><body id="content"><font size="2" face="Helvetica" color="black"><p > Kelp is commercially harvested to collect alginate, a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of brown algae. In kelp, alginate helps to provide flexibility so that kelp can move with the waves and not break during large swells. When processed, the alginate can be used to thicken and stabilize products that we use every day such as paint, toothpaste, cosmetics, beer and even ice cream. Giant kelp is harvested using large ships that cut about 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) from the canopy. Because kelp has such a tremendous growth rate, it recovers quickly and can be harvested again about a month later. Each year about 97,000 tons of giant kelp are harvested along the southern California coast.</p></font></body></html>
