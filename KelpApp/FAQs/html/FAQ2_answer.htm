Kelp forests are one of the most productive and dynamic ecosystems on earth, and support a high biodiversity of algal, invertebrate, fish and mammal species. Kelp forests provide a unique three-dimensional habitat that many species use for protection from predators, as well as food. Kelp forests typically contain many species of other algae in addition to giant kelp. Understory kelps such as winged kelp (<i>Pterygophora californica</i>) and southern sea palm (<i>Eisenia arborea</i>) provide habitat closer to the ocean floor.  </p></font></body></html>
