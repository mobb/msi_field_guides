<p > Kelps are large seaweeds belonging to
the brown algae group. Giant kelp (<i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i>) is the most
common type along the California coast. Kelp is one of the fastest growing species
of algae on earth, growing up to 50 cm (2 feet) per day. Similar to land
plants, kelp gets energy through photosynthesis, using sunlight to convert
carbon dioxide and water to simple sugars. Kelp has BLADES (1), which are
similar in shape to leaves. Blades absorb nutrients from the water and unlike
land plants, kelp has GAS BLADDERS (2) that float the blades towards the
surface to collect sunlight. These are attached to the STIPE (3), which is similar
to a stem. The kelp FRONDS (4) create the canopy. A root-like structure called
the HOLDFAST (5) anchors the kelp to the rocky seafloor. </p>
