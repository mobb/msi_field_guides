Kelp grows best in cool (6-14 C), nutrient-rich water, but has recently been discovered in tropical regions in areas of deep, cold water. There are many different kinds of kelps and over 20 different species are found in California. <i>Macrocystis pyrifera</i> is a perennial species and dominates kelp forests across the entire coast of California, while the bull kelp, <i>Nereocystis luetkeana</i>, is an annual species and is an important component of kelp forests along the central and northern California coast.</p>    </body></html>
