           Yes. From Crab and lobsters to cabezon and lingcod, there are many edible inhabitants of the kelp forest! But make sure you are not in a Marine Protected Area (MPA).  Visit the <a href="http://www.dfg.ca.gov/marine/mpa/">California Department of Fish and Wildlife (DFW)</a> for Maps of MPAs.
